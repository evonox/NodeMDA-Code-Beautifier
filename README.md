# NodeMDA Code Beautifier
This package provides helper services for code formatting for [NodeMDA](https://github.com/joelkoz/NodeMDA) 
code-generation engine and is not by default intended for a stand-alone use.

The package contains only a wrapper code for the [Atom-Beautifier Package](https://github.com/Glavin001/atom-beautify/).
